=begin
What changed between the last release and this release?
Now we have a shortcut for the writer method as well. Instead of writting it out we used attr_writer which means we can change the instace variable by calling the method of the same name. The difference between calling the reader is that we set this method equal to our intended value.

What was replaced?
We no longer need the change_age method

Is this code simpler than the last?
Yes, and shorter!
